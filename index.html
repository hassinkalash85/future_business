    <h2>Live & Love Life Project</h2>
	 
	<p>Living life to the fullest may seem out of reach. Do you love your life? Do you want to live to the fullest? If so, I am the man for the job.</p>
		
	<p>I love doing new things and inviting others to new things. My joy is to show others how to have a great time and enjoy the life they have in the world we live.</p>
		
	<p>Most people believe that you have to have money to have real fun, when that could be further from the truth. I did'nt grow up with a lot of money and me and my brothers had to find things to enjoy ourselves. I grew up with that thought in mind.  I have over 15 years of experience in having fun in Grand Rapids. Check me out via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hassin_1985/"target="_self"> Instgram</a>. And if you want to see me in action please watch my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hassin.alkalash/" target="_blank"> Facebook</a> where I just live life and share memories.</p>
